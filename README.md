# MECL-MC300

#### Project

The goal of this project is to enumerate each MECL circuit in a SPICE circuit/sub-circuit file. A secondary goal is to provide sample circuits from the application notes.

#### Introduction

In 1962, Motorola introduced a new family of logic circuits called MECL. In the following years, Motorola continued to introduce subsequent versions of the MECL family. Hence, this (first) family of circuits are sometimes called MECL I.
In later versions of Motorola manuals (e.g. MECL System Design Book, Forth Edition), Motorola uses five names when refering to the MECL  logic family: MECL I, MECL II, MECL III, MECL 10K, and MECL 10KH.
This project will focus on MECL I or MC300/MC350 series circuits.

#### MECL MC300 Series

The family of the MECL logic circuits are available as two different series, with part numbers which differ by "50" (e.g. MC303 and MC353 or MC311 and MC361).
The MC300 series is "extended" operating temperature range -55 to +125 (degrees C).
The MC350 series is "commercial" operating temperature range 0 to +75 (degrees C).
There are some idiosyncrasies to the part numbering schemes. I will try to identify each of these situations in individual markdown files for each part number, as needed.

#### Package Case Styles

MECL is offered in 10-lead metal can ("G" suffix), and 10-lead flat package ("F" suffix).
One exception is a 14-lead flat package, also using the "F" suffix for ordering.
Again, there are some idiosyncrasies to the part numbering schemes. I will try to identify each of these situations in individual markdown files for each part number, as needed.
The 1966 Motorola Semiconductor Handbook (page 13-59) details the packages as: 10-pin metal (CASE 71), 12-pin metal (CASE 98), 10-pin flat package (CASE 72), and 12-pin flat package (CASE 83).
Other manuals refer to the metal can package as TO-5, the 10-lead flat package as TO-91, and the 14-lead flat package as TO-86.

#### MECL circuits in SPICE

At the time of this document I am using a (partial) copy of the Motorola MECL Data Book, [Archive.org bitsavers collective](https://ia801902.us.archive.org/25/items/bitsavers_motoroladactronics02MECL_15757786/02_MECL.pdf)
The MECL family is detailed in section 2 of this book, and this PDF starts at section 2.
This book appears to be published on or after 1968.

Also, Application Note IC-11 written by Emory Garth has good information about the implementation of MECL logic blocks. A copy can be found in Google Books, [American Microelectronics Data Annual 1964â€“65](https://books.google.com/books?id=tdCjBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA250&ots=P0it3LPHe_&dq=emory%20garth%20motorola&pg=PA250#v=onepage&q=emory%20garth%20motorola&f=false)
Page 250.

The date of published information can be roughly established based on the MC312A (or MC362A) logic circuit, which first appears in the 1968 version of the Allied Electronics for Industry catalog \#670.

#### SPICE version

I current choice for SPICE is MacSpice v?.? on my MacBook Pro, which I use to test each circuit and/or sub-circuit.
Nevertheless, I believe that this syntax should work for all SPICE based on Berkley SPICE.

#### Personal Note

My first job after "higher education" was working on the UNIVAC 1100/90 at the Sperry manufacturing facility. As a matter of course, at that time, Unisys was being created with the merger of Sperry and Burroughs.
The UNIVAC 1100/90 and Unisys 2200/100 (and other versions if this system) employed ECL logic gates for the Central Processor Unit.
The CPU circuit boards (52 in total) used a complex set of many layers and large edge connectors on three sides to achieve a very high density of logic circuits; which Sperry terms High Performance Packaging (HPP).
This high-density logic required liquid cooling using a cold plate sandwiched between two PCBs placed face-to-face.
While the UNIVAC 1100/90 did not use MECL circuits or packages; the concept is similar, and the MECL family has much better documentation.
All of this to say: I have a fondness for ECL logic, and complex logic systems based on ECL logic.
