# MECL-MC300

This project the goal to enumerate each MECL circuit from the 1963 Motorola catalog in a SPICE circuit/sub-circuit file
Motorola only referred to this new family of integrated circuits as MECL; nevertheless, the next generation is referred to as MECL-II

## MECL circuits in SPICE

At the time of this document I am using a (partial) copy of the Motorola MECL Data Book, [Archive.org bitsavers collective](https://ia801902.us.archive.org/25/items/bitsavers_motoroladactronics02MECL_15757786/02_MECL.pdf)
The MECL family is detailed in section 2 of this book, and the PDF starts at section 2.

Also, Application Note IC-11 written by Emory Garth has good information about MECL logic blocks. A copy can be found in Google Books, [American Microelectronics Data Annual 1964â€“65](https://books.google.com/books?id=tdCjBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA250&ots=P0it3LPHe_&dq=emory%20garth%20motorola&pg=PA250#v=onepage&q=emory%20garth%20motorola&f=false)

## SPICE version

I am currently using MacSpice locally on my MacBook Pro
I believe that this syntax should work for all SPICE 3
