# MC309 Dual 2-Input NOR gate

#### Introduction

This logic circuit is comprised of two 3-input NOR gates.
The logic circuits MC310 and MC311 are related to MC309.
MC310 disconnects the NOR2 output buffer emitter from the emitter resistor.
MC311 disconnects the NOR1 output buffer emitter from the emitter resistor, and removes the NOR1 emitter resistor.


#### Reference

The main circuit is described in the MECL Data Book section 2 at page 2-14
This page describes the MC309 logic circuit in the 10-lead metal can.
This page also shows the details for MC310 and MC311.
I did find the pin-outs for MC309, MC310 and MC311 in the Motorola Semiconductor Handbook Second Edition page 13-62.
However, this manual does not provide any other detail for the MC309 circuit.
