# MC312 Dual 3-Input NOR gate

#### Introduction

This logic circuit is comprised of two 3-input NOR gates.
Given the number of inputs and outputs and power connections, this is difficult to deliver in a 10-lead metal can package.
The other two packages are delivered in a 12-pin or a 14-pin package

#### Reference

The main circuit is described in the MECL Data Book section 2 at page 2-16
This page describes the MC312A logic circuit in the 10-lead metal can.
This page only alludes to other versions without the internal bias driver, but do not provide details.
I did find the pin-outs for the MC312F and MC312G in the Motorola Semiconductor Handbook Second Edition page 13-62.
However, this manual did not detail the MC312A circuit.
